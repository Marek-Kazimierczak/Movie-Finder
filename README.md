# Movie Finder App

### About

 This is a Movie Finder App project built with React, Redux, and TypeScript, leveraging Webpack and Sass.

### Installation

Project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to run. Instead of Yarn you can use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm/), but the following instruction is about using yarn.

Secondly, make sure you have installed TypeScript and Webpack globally on your machine. If you are missing any of them, please execute following commands in your terminal:
```sh
yarn add global typescript
yarn add global webpack
```

Thirdly clone or download the repository from gitHub. To clone you can paste this code in your terminal after you choose the right directory for the project: 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Marek-Kazimierczak/Movie-Finder.git
```

The next step is to move to the project directory and install the dependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd Movie-Finder
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```
Then your default browser will open automatically and run the app on a local server.
Finally, you can view **Movie Finder** in the browser -  http://localhost:3000/.
